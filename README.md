## about
raisin' pets is a mobile application available on iOS and Android that aims to help you track your pets' data and also learn about how to feed, clean, and entertain your furry friends.

## features
1. Google login
2. Create a pet profile and assign them an avatar (by taking a pic or choosing from gallery)
3. See various tutorials for each of your pets, depending on their age and size
4. Track your pet's physical activity by allowing the app to use your phone's GPS in exercise sessions
5. Create food reminders: get notifications everyday, at any time you want, so that you don't forget about your pet's breakfast or dinner.

## implementation
The application was implemented in two cross-platform mobile frameworks, namely Capacitor and NativeScript, which both communicate with a .NET Core server. They both use Angular as the base web framework, which they enhance to create a fully native mobile application.
